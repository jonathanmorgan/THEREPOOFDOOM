Installing Network Builder
=================================================================================

For now, just have classes/models that hold network information pre-query.

To install:
- install and configure django to talk with a database (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/).
- grab the django folder from this repo.
- install and configure the network site (settings-anon.py has a barebones install except for your database information), or install the network_builder application in your existing site.
- use manage.py to load the attribute types fixtures (python manage.py loaddata attribute_type.json).
- use manage.py to load the attribute derivation types fixtures (python manage.py loaddata attribute_derivation_type.json)
- play (and hope it doesn't break!).
